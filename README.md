# Node.js API with a Static Frontend on ZEIT Now

To get started with this project yourself, you can use [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize it.

## Automatic Deployments with Git

Using either [Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/github) or [Now for GitLab](https://zeit.co/gitlab), you can push this project to a Git repository and it will deploy automatically.

If on anything other than the default branch, with each push your project will be deployed, automatically, to a unique staging URL.

If pushing or merging to the default branch, your project will be deployed and aliased in a production environment, automatically.
